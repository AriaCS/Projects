-- Extract relevant data from the database and generate insights from it.

# Project Goals:

# Identify top-selling products: 
SELECT P.name, COUNT(*) AS total_sales
FROM Products P
JOIN Sales S ON S.product_id = P.product_id
GROUP BY P.product_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 10;

# Analyze sales trends over time:
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', sales_date) AS month, SUM(total_price) AS total_sales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month ASC;

# Identify patterns in customer demographics:
SELECT gender, AVG(age) AS average_age, COUNT(*) AS total_customers
FROM Customers
GROUP BY gender
ORDER BY total_customers DESC;

# Analyze sales performance by sales representatives:
SELECT S.sales_rep_id, R.name AS sales_rep_name, COUNT(*) AS total_sales
FROM Sales S
JOIN SalesRepresentatives R ON R.sales_rep_id = S.sales_rep_id
GROUP BY S.sales_rep_id, sales_rep_name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
